		<p>For most patients, basic preventative and restorative care is all that is needed to maintain a healthy beautiful smile.  However, if you would like to change your smile to become more esthetically pleasing, our office offers a number of procedures that can improve the appearance of your teeth.</p>

		<p>Cosmetic procedures we offer include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Veneers and crowns</li>
			<li>In-office and at-home whitening</li>
			<li>Fixing chips and cracks</li>
			<li>Closing spaces between teeth</li>
			<li>Replacing old, unattractive dental fillings and restorations</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Veneers</h2>
		<p>Veneers are thin pieces of porcelain that are custom made by our quality dental laboratory to the exact shape and shade specifications for your new smile.  Veneers are a very conservative treatment, as little to no dental structure needs to be removed to achieve the ideal shape and color you desire.  Veneers can be used to “permanently whiten” your teeth, close spaces between your teeth, and give you a permanent cosmetic solution.</p>

	<h2>Whitening</h2>
		<p>At Foster Family Dental, we offer two methods to whiten your teeth, both of which are tremendously effective:</p>  

		<ul>
			<li><span class="ul-heading">In-Office Whitening</span>:  In as little as 30 minutes, your teeth can be dramatically whiter, and the results can last up to a year.  Dr. Foster utilizes EZ-White, a light-activated whitening system that is safe and conservative, producing little to no sensitivity in most patients.</li>
			<li><span class="ul-heading">Custom Trays</span>:  Known as the traditional professional whitening method, custom trays can be made to fit your teeth for at-home whitening.  Though the results are more gradual than in-office whitening, there are many advantages to having custom trays made.  Touch-ups are easy and cost effective and you can take advantage of the many different whitening products and strengths we offer at our office.</li>
