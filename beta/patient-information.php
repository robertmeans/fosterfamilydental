	<h1>Patient Information</h1>
		<p>At Foster Family Dental, we are happy to assist you in filing your dental insurance.  We are well versed in most dental plans and can maximize the benefits offered by your particular plan.</p>

		<p>Dr. Foster is an in-network provider with Delta Dental Premier.</p>

		<p>Payment is due at the time of service, including dental copays and estimates.  We gladly accept cash, checks, MasterCard, Visa, and Discover.</p>  

		<p>For those who do not have dental insurance, we invite you to take advantage of <span class="ul-heading">Foster Family Dentalâ€™s Dental Savings Plan</span>.  This plan is designed to help people maintain their oral health when they are self-employed, unemployed, or just without dental coverage.   We hope this will help people who might otherwise feel they cannot afford dental care.  In a 12-month period the plan includes:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>2 routine cleanings</li>
			<li>2 exams (includes oral cancer and periodontal disease screenings)</li>
			<li>Diagnostic radiographs (2 to 4 bitewings)</li>
			<li>1 fluoride treatment</li>
			<li>All other x-rays, restorative work, emergency care, and whitening are offered at a 15% discount</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The fee for this plan is $350 for adults and $299 for children.  Please give our office a call for more details.</p>
