	<h1>Restorative Dentistry</h1>
		<p>When teeth are worn, cracked, chipped, missing, infected, or have cavities, we have many different options to restore them to a natural, beautiful state.   These options include composite (tooth-colored) fillings, crowns (caps), bridges, dentures, and implants.</p>  

		<p>Dr. Foster will always provide you with different options for restoring your teeth, taking into consideration what your concerns and ultimate goals are.   If you have any questions regarding treatment presented to you, even by another dental provider, Dr. Foster is always happy and available to consult with you. </p> 

		<p>Many restorations last several years, decades even.  However, please note that no tooth restoration is considered permanent.  Like natural teeth, restored teeth are also susceptible to wear, decay, cracks and infection.  Regular dental check-ups, cleanings, and x-rays will help in maintaining your investment for as long as possible.</p>

	<h2>Composite (tooth-colored) Fillings</h2>
		<p>Composite fillings are an aesthetic and conservative way to treat tooth decay. Composite fillings are ideal for replacing small to moderate amounts of tooth structure. These types of fillings are adhesively bonded to teeth, allowing you to preserve more of your natural tooth. With composite fillings, we can closely match the shade of your natural tooth.  Composite fillings can also replace discolored and leaking metal fillings, repair chipped teeth, and close spaces between front teeth.</p>

		<p>At Foster Family Dental, we have chosen to provide our patients with a mercury-free facility and do not place amalgam (silver) fillings.  When placed correctly, new generations of composite filling material can last a long time.  Composite fillings require much less tooth structure to be removed and sometimes can be placed without being numb.  Additionally, you can eat on tooth-colored fillings immediately after they are placed.  There are many benefits in restoring your tooth with composite fillings.</p>

<div id="crowns" class="services-ul">
	<h2>Crowns</h2>
	<p>When a tooth presents in a condition beyond a simple composite filling repair, crowns are an excellent choice to restore it to its proper shape and function.  There are many different crowns, and each crown has its advantages depending on the ultimate function of the tooth.  If crowns are necessary for you, Dr. Foster will discuss each different type and make a recommendation.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="ul-heading">Full Gold Crowns</span> - These crowns look gold, but are composed of a mixture of metals with a high gold content.  Gold crowns are excellent for back teeth (molars) and have a record for being one of the longest lasting types of crowns.</li>
		<li><span class="ul-heading">All Porcelain Crowns</span>-  These metal-free crowns are composed solely of porcelain, however there are many different types of porcelain crowns, some of which are more esthetic than others.  Dr. Foster utilizes a local Colorado lab known for their esthetic ceramic restorations and together we can transform your smile with high-quality, long-lasting materials.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When is a crown necessary?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>When a tooth is cracked or brittle</li>
		<li>After root canal therapy</li>
		<li>When a tooth has a large amount of decay that a filling cannot restore adequately</li>
		<li>When large, old fillings are breaking down or cracking the remaining tooth structure</li>
		<li>For esthetic purposes, if you have a desire to improve your smile</li>
	</ul>

<div id="bridges" class="services-ul">
	<h2>Bridges</h2>
		<p>Bridges, like crowns and other restorations, should not be considered a permanent solution.  Though materials continue to improve, these restorations are susceptible to breaking, decay, wear, etc.  However, with proper maintenance, many patients utilize these restorations for many, many years.</p>
</div>
<div class="btt-sep"><a href="#top-of-page">Back to top</a></div>
<div id="dentures-partials">
	<h2>Dentures &amp; Partials</h2>
		<p>When many or all of your teeth are missing, dentures and partials are an effective way to restore your smile, both esthetically and functionally.</p>  

		<p>Complete dentures are used when all of the teeth are missing.  Should complete dentures be in your future, Dr. Foster can discuss your options to make sure you do not have to go ANY time without teeth.  Complete dentures take time to make correctly and take time to get adjusted to.  Experiences differ from patient to patient; should you need more support, implants can be placed so your dentures can “snap” into place.  Though a longer process and more expensive, patients are usually much happier with implant-supported dentures.</p>  

		<p>Partials can replace as little or as many missing teeth a patient may have.  There are many types of partials some made with metal with acrylic and others made fully of acrylic or nylon.  Dr. Foster is happy to go over your options and the benefits of each type of partial should they be a treatment option for you.</p>
